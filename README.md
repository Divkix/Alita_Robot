Alita is a Telegram Group managment bot made using **[Gotgbot](https://github.com/PaulSonOfLars/gotgbot)** and **[Go](https://go.dev)**, which makes it modern and faster than most of the exisitng Telegram Chat Managers.

**Alita's features over other bots:**
- Modern
- Fast
- Fully asynchronous
- Fully open-source
- Frequently updated
- Multi Language Support

Can be found on Telegram as [@Alita_Robot](https://t.me/Alita_Robot)
</br>

Alita is currently available in 1 Language as of now:
- **US English**

More languages can be managed in the _locales_ folder. Although we have added support for languages in bot, we still need contributors to translate the bot to other languages.

More langauges have been added to locales folder but need some configuration.

Help us bring more languages to the bot by contributing to the project on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/alitarobot)

## Requirements
- You need to have a *PostgreSQL Database* (Recommended)
- You also need a *Redis Database* for caching (Required): Get a free redis database from [here](https://redis.com/try-free/)
- Linux/Windows machine (Ubuntu/Debain-based OS Preferred or Windows 10/Server2016 and later)

or
- Docker (Easiest way to setup the bot)

## How to setup

First Step!
- Star **‚≠ê** the repository!!
- Fork **üî±** the repository before deploying and make changes in the fork.

It really motivates me to continue this project further.

### Deploy to Heroku
- Get your `API_ID` and `API_HASH` from [here](https://my.telegram.org/)
- Get your Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

**Note:** As it is banned with an unknown reason in heroku, follow the below steps carefully!
- First Fork this repo `:)`
- secondly, create an empty app in the Heroku, with a custom app name; and select Europe region for faster speed.
- Now go to the deploy tab of your app and under deployment method select GitHub and connect it.
- after that, type the forked repo name and select it now select main branch and enable auto deploy, at last click on deploy now button!

- Lastly, you must fill up all the vars in heroku (if using heroku) as directed in app.json file and now turn on the worker dyno to run it `:)`

**Must Add in heroku [config](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/yourappname/settings) :**
- `DB_URI` : Get one from [mongodb](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
- `OWNER_ID` : your telegram id
- `MESSAGE_DUMP` : must be start with `-100` or your bot added in as **admin**
### Traditional

- Download a binary from [releases](https://github.com/divideprojects/Alita_Robot/releases) page specific to your PC.
- Set the required env variables and run the binary

**Note:** Not a lot of people may be able to run using this because the instructions aren't clear but I'll try to make it clear in future.

### Docker

We currently publish a `ghcr.io/divideprojects/alita_robot` Docker image based on alpine.

Set the Environmental vars using the `-e` flag in while running the container.

If all works well, bot should send message to the **MESSAGE_DUMP** Group!

### Webhook Mode with Cloudflare Tunnel (Production)

Alita now supports webhook mode for production deployments using Cloudflare Tunnel. This is more efficient than polling and works behind firewalls without opening ports.

#### Prerequisites
- Cloudflare account with a domain added to Cloudflare
- Docker and Docker Compose installed

#### Step 1: Create Cloudflare Tunnel
1. Go to [Cloudflare Zero Trust Dashboard](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Navigate to **Networks > Tunnels**
3. Click **Create a tunnel** ‚Üí Choose **Cloudflared**
4. Name your tunnel (e.g., `alita-telegram-bot`)
5. **Copy the tunnel token** from the command shown (the long string after `--token`)

#### Step 2: Configure Public Hostname
1. In your tunnel dashboard, go to **Public Hostnames** tab
2. Click **Add a public hostname**
3. Configure:
   - **Subdomain**: `alita-bot` (or your preference)
   - **Domain**: Select your domain
   - **Service**: `http://alita:8080`
   - **Path**: `/webhook/your-secret` (replace with your actual `WEBHOOK_SECRET`)

#### Step 3: Environment Configuration
Create your `.env` file with webhook settings:

```bash
# Bot Configuration
BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
OWNER_ID=your_telegram_user_id
MESSAGE_DUMP=-100xxxxxxxxx

# Database Configuration  
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/alita_robot?sslmode=disable
REDIS_ADDRESS=redis:6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password

# Webhook Configuration
USE_WEBHOOKS=true
WEBHOOK_DOMAIN=https://alita-bot.yourdomain.com
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-random-secret-string-here
WEBHOOK_PORT=8080

# Cloudflare Tunnel
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=eyJhIjoiNzU1...your-tunnel-token-here
```

#### Step 4: Enable Cloudflare Tunnel in Docker
Uncomment the `cloudflared` service in your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
# Uncomment this section for webhook mode
cloudflared:
  image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
  container_name: alita-cloudflared
  environment:
    - TUNNEL_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN}
  command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run
  restart: unless-stopped
  depends_on:
    - alita
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 128M
        cpus: "0.1"
```

#### Step 5: Register Webhook with Telegram
After your bot is running, register the webhook URL with Telegram:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token
# Replace the URL with your actual webhook URL
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://alita-bot.yourdomain.com/webhook/your-secret",
    "secret_token": "your-secret"
  }'
```

#### Step 6: Deploy
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Verify Setup
Check webhook status:
```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/getWebhookInfo"
```

#### Switch Back to Polling
To disable webhooks and return to polling mode:
```bash
# Clear webhook
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_BOT_TOKEN/setWebhook" -d "url="

# Update environment
USE_WEBHOOKS=false
```

#### Webhook vs Polling Comparison

| Feature | Webhook Mode | Polling Mode |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Performance** | ‚ö° Real-time updates | üêå 1-3 second delay |
| **Resource Usage** | üíö Lower CPU/bandwidth | üü° Higher CPU/bandwidth |
| **Setup Complexity** | üîß Requires domain setup | ‚úÖ Simple, works anywhere |
| **Production Ready** | ‚úÖ Recommended | ‚ö†Ô∏è Development only |
| **Firewall Friendly** | ‚úÖ Works behind NAT | ‚ùå Needs outbound access |

### Other

You can download all binaries and release artifacts from the Releases page. Binaries are built for macOS, Linux, Windows, for amd64 and arm64 architectures.

If a binary does not yet exist for the OS/architecture you use, please open a GitHub Issue.


## Verify Signature

You can verify the integrity and authenticity of any released artifact using a public GPG key. All release artifacts are signed and have a corresponding signature file. Release artifacts are available on the Releases page.

# fetch GPG signing key
```bash
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 9CAFFF2AC5F94C7C
```
# example: verify a release package
```bash
gpg --verify alita_robot_2.0.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz.sig alita_robot_2.0.1_darwin_amd64.tar.gz || echo "Verification failed!"
```
