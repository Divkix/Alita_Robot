   :::caution[Admin permissions are required]
   Alita **cannot** moderate your group without admin permissions. Without them, commands like ban, mute, and delete will fail silently.
   :::

   2. Go to **Administrators**
   3. Click **Add Administrator**
   4. Select **Alita Robot**
   5. Enable these permissions:
      - Delete messages
      - Ban users
      - Invite users via link
      - Pin messages
      - Manage video chats (optional)

   ```

   **Enable CAPTCHA (Recommended)**

   :::tip[Pro tip]
