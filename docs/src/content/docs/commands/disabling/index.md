# ❌ Disabling Commands

This module allows you to disable some commonly used commands, So, no one can use them. It'll also allow you to autodelete them, stopping people from blue texting.

*Admin commands*:
× /disable `<commandname>`: Stop users from using commandname in this group.
× /enable `<item name>`: Allow users from using commandname in this group.
× /disableable: List all disableable commands.
× /disabledel `<yes/no/on/off>`: Delete disabled commands when used by non-admins.
× /disabled: List the disabled commands in this chat.

Note:
When disabling a command, the command only gets disabled for non-admins. All admins can still use those commands.
Disabled commands are still accessible through the /connect feature. If you would be interested to see this disabled too, let me know in the support chat.
