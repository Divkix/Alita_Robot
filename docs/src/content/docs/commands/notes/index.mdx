# Notes Commands

Save data for future users with notes! Notes are great to save random tidbits of information — a phone number, a nice gif, a funny picture, anything!

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="User Commands">
    ### User Commands <Badge text="Everyone" variant="success" />

    | Command | Description | Disableable |

    :::tip[Quick Access]
    You can also retrieve notes using the `#notename` shorthand — no need to type `/get`.

    #rules
    #welcome
    /get notename noformat    # View raw note content
    ```
    :::

## Note Formatting Options

When saving a note, you can use special tags to control its behavior:

| `{private}` | Note will only be sent via DM, never in group |
| `{noprivate}` | Note will only be sent in group, never via DM |
| `{admin}` | Note can only be accessed by admins |
| `{protect}` | Content cannot be forwarded |
| `{nonotif}` | Send without notification sound |
| `{nopreview}` | Disable link preview |

:::note[Private Notes Mode]
When private notes are enabled (`/privatenotes on`), all notes are sent to users via DM instead of in the group. Individual notes can override this with `{private}` or `{noprivate}` tags.
