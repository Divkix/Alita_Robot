## Features

### Anti-Channel Pin

When enabled, the bot will automatically unpin any message that gets auto-pinned by a linked channel. This is useful when you want to maintain control over what gets pinned in your group.

:::caution[Important]
When using anti-channel pins, always use the `/unpin` command instead of unpinning manually through Telegram. Manual unpinning will cause the old message to get re-pinned when the channel sends new messages.
:::

### Clean Linked

When enabled, the bot will automatically delete any messages sent to the group from the linked channel. This keeps your group chat clean from cross-posted channel content.

### Permapin

Create custom pinned messages with:
- Text with HTML/Markdown formatting
- Inline buttons with URLs
- Media attachments (photos, documents, stickers, audio, video, voice notes, video notes)
- All standard message fillings (`{first}`, `{chatname}`, etc.)

:::note[Connection Support]
The following commands work when connected to a chat via `/connect`:
`/antichannelpin`, `/cleanlinked`

## Module Aliases

## Required Permissions

## Technical Notes

- The `/unpinall` command shows a confirmation dialog before unpinning all messages
- Permapin supports all media types that Telegram supports for pinning
- Anti-channel pin and clean linked settings persist across bot restarts
