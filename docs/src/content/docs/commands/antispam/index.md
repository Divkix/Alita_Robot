# 📦 Antispam Commands

The antispam module provides automatic, behind-the-scenes spam protection for your groups.

Unlike other modules, it operates automatically without requiring any user commands.

**How It Works:**
Per-user-per-chat rate limiting prevents spam automatically.
- **Rate Limit:** 18 messages per second per user per chat
- **Automatic:** No configuration required - works out of the box
- **Transparent:** Silently drops excessive messages without disrupting normal users
- **Per-User Tracking:** Busy groups with many legitimate users won't trigger false positives


**Technical Details**

**Rate Limiting Algorithm:**
The module uses a sliding window approach:
1. **First Message:** Starts tracking with count = 1
2. **Subsequent Messages:** Increments counter within the time window
3. **Window Expiry:** Counter resets when the time window (1 second) expires
4. **Threshold Exceeded:** Messages beyond 18/second are silently dropped

**Memory Management:**
- Automatic cleanup: Expired tracking entries are removed every 5 minutes
- No memory leaks: Background goroutine prevents unbounded memory growth
- Efficient storage: Only active users are tracked


## Technical Notes

**Limitations**
- **No User Commands:** Cannot be enabled/disabled per chat
- **Fixed Threshold:** 18 messages/second is hardcoded
- **No Logging to Chat:** Spam events are only logged server-side

Use **Antispam** for automatic background protection and **Antiflood** for configurable flood control.
