# 📦 Languages Commands

Not able to change language of the bot?
Easily change by using this module!

Just type /lang and use inline keyboard to choose a language for yourself or your group.

You can help us bring bot to more languages by helping on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/alita_robot)

**How It Works**
- **Private Chats:** Any user can change their personal language
- **Group Chats:** Only admins can change the group language

Language preferences are cached for performance and stored separately for users and groups.
