# Blacklists Commands

Automatically detect and act on blacklisted words in your group. When a user sends a message containing a blacklisted trigger, the bot deletes the message and takes the configured action.

:::caution[Admin Permissions Required]
Most commands require admin permissions with restrict rights. `/blacklists` is available to all users. `/rmallbl` and `/remallbl` require chat owner.
