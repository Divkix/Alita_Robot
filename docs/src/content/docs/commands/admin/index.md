# 👑 Admin Commands

Make it easy to promote and demote users with the admin module!

*User Commands:*
× /adminlist: List the admins in the current chat.

*Admin Commands:*
× /promote `<reply/username/mention/userid>`: Promote a user.
× /demote `<reply/username/mention/userid>`: Demote a user.
× /title `<reply/username/mention/userid>` `<custom title>`: Set custom title for user

**Anonymous Admin Support**

The `/anonadmin` command allows group owners to toggle anonymous admin recognition:
`/anonadmin on` - Enable anonymous admin checks
`/anonadmin off` - Disable anonymous admin checks

When enabled, the bot will request verification for admin actions from anonymous accounts.

**How Anonymous Admin Verification Works:**
1. Bot detects sender is GroupAnonymousBot
2. Original message cached with 20-second TTL
3. "Verify Admin" button sent to chat
4. Clicking user verified as admin, command executed
5. Button expires after 20 seconds if not verified

**Supported Commands:**
Admin: /promote, /demote, /title
Bans: /ban, /dban, /sban, /tban, /unban
Mutes: /mute, /smute, /dmute, /tmute, /unmute
Pins: /pin, /unpin, /permapin, /unpinall
Purges: /purge, /del
Warns: /warn, /swarn, /dwarn
