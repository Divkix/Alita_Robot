# Bans Commands

Sometimes users can be annoying and you might want to remove them from your chat. This module helps you deal with that — ban, kick, and restrict users, and unban them later if they behave.

:::caution[Admin Permissions Required]
All ban and restrict commands require admin permissions with ban/restrict rights. Only `/kickme` is available to regular users.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="User Commands">
    ### User Commands <Badge text="Everyone" variant="success" />

    | Command | Description | Disableable |
    |---------|-------------|-------------|
    | `/kickme` | Kicks the user who issued the command. | No |

    :::note
    `/kickme` only works for non-admin users. Admins cannot kick themselves.

  <TabItem label="Ban Commands">
    ### Ban Commands <Badge text="Admin Only" variant="caution" />

    | Command | Description | Disableable |
    |---------|-------------|-------------|
    | `/ban` | Bans a user (via handle or reply). | No |
    | `/sban` | Bans a user silently — no group message, deletes your command. | No |
    | `/dban` | Bans a user and deletes the replied message. | No |
    | `/tban` | Bans a user for a specified time (via handle or reply). | No |
    | `/unban` | Unbans a user (via handle or reply). | No |
    | `/kick` | Kick a user from the group (by reply, @handle, or user ID). | No |
    | `/dkick` | Delete the replied message and kick the sender. | No |

    :::tip[Temporary Ban Format]
    Use `/tban` with a time suffix: `m` = minutes, `h` = hours, `d` = days.

    ```text
    /tban @user 30m    # Ban for 30 minutes
    /tban @user 2h     # Ban for 2 hours
    /tban @user 1d     # Ban for 1 day
    ```

  <TabItem label="Restrict Commands">
    ### Restrict Commands <Badge text="Admin Only" variant="caution" />

    | Command | Description | Disableable |
    |---------|-------------|-------------|
    | `/restrict` | Shows an InlineKeyboard to choose from kick, ban, and mute. | No |
    | `/unrestrict` | Shows an InlineKeyboard to choose from unmute and unban. | No |
