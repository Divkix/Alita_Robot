# Reports Commands

We're all busy people who don't have time to monitor our groups 24/7. But how do you react if someone in your group is spamming? Reports let your users flag problems for admins.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="User Commands">
    ### User Commands <Badge text="Everyone" variant="success" />

    | Command | Description | Disableable |
    |---------|-------------|-------------|
    | `/report` | Reply to a message to report it to admins. | Yes |

    You can also mention `@admin` in a reply to report — it works the same way as `/report`.

    :::note
    You **must** reply to a message to report a user. You cannot just use `@admin` to tag admins without replying.
    :::

    :::tip
    Neither `/report` nor `@admin` will get triggered if used by admins — admins don't need to report to themselves.
    :::
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Admin Commands">
    ### Admin Commands <Badge text="Admin Only" variant="caution" />

    | Command | Description | Disableable |
    |---------|-------------|-------------|
    | `/reports` | Change report setting, or view current status. | No |

    **Toggle reports:**
    ```text
    /reports on     # Enable reports (in PM: receive notifications; in group: enable reporting)
    /reports off    # Disable reports
    ```

    **Block/unblock users from reporting:**
    ```text
    /reports block          # Reply to block a user from reporting
    /reports unblock        # Reply to unblock a user
    /reports showblocklist  # View blocked users
    ```

    :::note[Personal vs Group Settings]
    - **In PM:** `/reports on/off` toggles whether **you** receive report notifications
    - **In Group:** `/reports on/off` toggles whether reporting is enabled for **that group**
    :::
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

1. **Reply to the offending message** with `/report` or mention `@admin`
2. The bot sends a notification mentioning all admins who have reports enabled
3. The notification includes action buttons for quick moderation

**Admin Action Buttons:**
- **Message** — Link to the reported message
- **Kick** — Kick the reported user (they can rejoin)
- **Ban** — Permanently ban the reported user
- **Delete** — Delete the reported message
- **Resolved** — Mark the report as resolved without action

## Who Can Report?

| | Can Report | Can Be Reported |
|---|---|---|
| Regular users | Yes | Yes |
| Admins | No | No |
| Blocked users | No | — |
| Anonymous channels | No | No |
| The bot itself | — | No |
