# Connections Commands

This module allows you to connect to a chat's database and add things to it without the chat knowing about it! For obvious reasons, you need to be an admin to add things; but any member can view your data. (Banned/kicked users cannot.)

:::tip[How to Get Your Chat ID]
Use the `/id` command in your group to get the chat ID. Don't be surprised if the ID is negative — all super groups have negative IDs.
