# Performance and Concurrency Settings (Optional)
# These settings control worker pool sizes for concurrent operations
# If not set, the system will use intelligent defaults based on your CPU cores

# Chat validation worker pool - controls how many chats are validated concurrently during cleanup
# Default: 10 workers
# Recommended: 5-15 depending on API rate limits and system resources
#CHAT_VALIDATION_WORKERS=10

# Database operation worker pool - controls concurrent database operations
# Default: 5 workers
# Recommended: 3-10 depending on database connection limits
#DATABASE_WORKERS=5

# Message processing pipeline workers - handles concurrent message validation stages
# Default: Number of CPU cores (capped at 8)
# Recommended: 4-12 depending on message volume
#MESSAGE_PIPELINE_WORKERS=8

# Bulk operation workers - handles large batch database operations
# Default: 4 workers
# Recommended: 2-8 depending on database performance
#BULK_OPERATION_WORKERS=4

# Cache operation workers - handles concurrent cache operations
# Default: 3 workers
# Recommended: 2-5 for most use cases
#CACHE_WORKERS=3

# Background statistics collection workers - collects performance metrics
# Default: 2 workers
# Recommended: 1-3 workers
#STATS_COLLECTION_WORKERS=2

# Safety and Resource Limits (Optional)
# These settings protect against resource exhaustion

# Maximum concurrent operations across all worker pools
# Default: 50 operations
# Recommended: 30-100 depending on server resources
#MAX_CONCURRENT_OPERATIONS=50

# Default timeout for operations in seconds
# Default: 30 seconds
# Recommended: 15-60 seconds depending on operation complexity
#OPERATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30

# Monitoring and Statistics (Optional)
# Enable performance monitoring and background statistics collection

# Enable automatic performance monitoring and alerting
# Default: true in production (when DEBUG=false), false in debug mode
# Set to true to enable detailed performance tracking
#ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true

# Enable background statistics collection
# Default: true in production (when DEBUG=false), false in debug mode
# Set to true to collect system metrics in the background
#ENABLE_BACKGROUND_STATS=true
