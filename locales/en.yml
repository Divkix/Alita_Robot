    and much more. Go ahead and experiment!

    <b>Supported markdown</b>:

    - <code>`code words`</code>: Backticks are used for monospace fonts. Shows as:
    <code>code words</code>.

    - <code>_italic words_</code>: Underscores are used for italic fonts. Shows as:
    <i>italic words</i>.

    - <code>*bold words*</code>: Asterisks are used for bold fonts. Shows as: <b>bold
    words</b>.

    - <code>~strikethrough~</code>: Tildes are used for strikethrough. Shows as: <strike>strikethrough</strike>.

    - <code>||spoiler||</code>: Double vertical bars are used for spoilers. Shows
    as: <tg-spoiler>Spoiler</tg-spoiler>.

    - <code>```pre```</code>: To make the formatter ignore other formatting characters
    inside the text formatted with ''```'', will be like: <code>**bold** | *bold*</code>.

    - <code>__underline__</code>: Double underscores are used for underlines. Shows
    as: underline. NOTE: Some clients try to be smart and interpret it as italic.
    In that case, try to use your app''s built-in formatting.

    - <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for hyperlinks.
    Shows as: <a href=''https://example.com/''>hyperlink</a>.

    - <code>[My Button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used
    for creating buttons. This example will create a button named "My button" which
    opens <code>example.com</code> when clicked.


    If you would like to send buttons on the same row, use the <code>:same</code>
    formatting.

    <b>Example:</b>

    <code>[button 1](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

    <code>[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)</code>

    <code>[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>

    This will show button 1 and 2 on the same line, with 3 underneath.'
  formatting.fillings: Fillings
  formatting.random: '<b>Random Content</b>


    Another thing that can be fun, is to randomise the contents of a message. Make
    things a little more personal by changing welcome messages, or changing notes!

    How to use random contents:

    - %%%: This separator can be used to add  random replies to the bot.

    For example:

    <code>hello

    %%%

    how are you</code>

    This will randomly choose between sending the first message, "hello", or the second
    message, "how are you".

    Use this to make Alita feel a bit more customised! (only works in filters/notes)

    Example welcome message:

    - Every time a new user joins, they''ll be presented with one of the three messages
    shown here.

    -> /filter "hey"

    hello there <code>{first}</code>!

    %%%

    Ooooh, <code>{first}</code> how are you?

    %%%

    Sup? <code>{first}</code>'
