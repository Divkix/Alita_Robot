            - <code>~strikethrough~</code>: Tildes are used for strikethrough. Shows as: <strike>strikethrough</strike>.
            - <code>||spoiler||</code>: Double vertical bars are used for spoilers. Shows as: <tg-spoiler>Spoiler</tg-spoiler>.
            - <code>```pre```</code>: To make the formatter ignore other formatting characters inside the text formatted with '```', will be like: <code>**bold** | *bold*</code>.
            - <code>__underline__</code>: Double underscores are used for underlines. Shows as: underline. NOTE: Some clients try to be smart and interpret it as italic. In that case, try to use your app's built-in formatting.
            - <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for hyperlinks. Shows as: <a href='https://example.com/'>hyperlink</a>.
            - <code>[My Button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for creating buttons. This example will create a button named "My button" which opens <code>example.com</code> when clicked.

            If you would like to send buttons on the same row, use the <code>:same</code> formatting.
            <b>Example:</b>
            <code>[button 1](buttonurl:example.com)</code>
            <code>[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)</code>
            <code>[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
            This will show button 1 and 2 on the same line, with 3 underneath.
        Random: |-
            <b>Random Content</b>

            Another thing that can be fun, is to randomise the contents of a message. Make things a little more personal by changing welcome messages, or changing notes!
            How to use random contents:
            - %%%: This separator can be used to add  random replies to the bot.
            For example:
            <code>hello
            %%%
            how are you</code>
            This will randomly choose between sending the first message, "hello", or the second message, "how are you".
            Use this to make Alita feel a bit more customised! (only works in filters/notes)
            Example welcome message:
            - Every time a new user joins, they'll be presented with one of the three messages shown here.
            -> /filter "hey"
            hello there <code>{first}</code>!
            %%%
            Ooooh, <code>{first}</code> how are you?
            %%%
            Sup? <code>{first}</code>
