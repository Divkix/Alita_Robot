      Filters are case insensitive; every time someone says your trigger words,
      Alita will reply something else! This can be used to create your commands,
      if desired.


      Commands:

      - /filter <trigger> <reply>: Every time someone says trigger, the bot will
      reply with sentence. For multiple word filters, quote the trigger.

      - /filters: List all chat filters.

      - /stop <trigger>: Stop the bot from replying to trigger.

      - /stopall: Stop ALL filters in the current chat. This action cannot be
      undone.


      Examples:

      - Set a filter:

      -> /filter hello Hello there! How are you?

      - Set a multiword filter:

      -> /filter hello friend Hello back! Long time no see!

      - Set a filter that can only be used by admins:

      -> /filter example This filter won't  happen if a normal user says it
      {admin}

      - To save a file, image, gif, or any other attachment, simply reply to the
      file with:

      -> /filter trigger

  Formatting:
    help_msg: >-
      Alita supports a large number of formatting options to make your messages
      more expressive. Take a look by clicking the buttons below!
    Markdown: >-
      <b>Markdown Formatting</b>


      You can format your message using <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>,
      <u>underline</u>, and much more. Go ahead and experiment!

      <b>Supported markdown</b>:

      - <code>`code words`</code>: Backticks are used for monospace fonts. Shows
      as: <code>code words</code>.

      - <code>_italic words_</code>: Underscores are used for italic fonts.
      Shows as: <i>italic words</i>.

      - <code>*bold words*</code>: Asterisks are used for bold fonts. Shows as:
      <b>bold words</b>.

      - <code>~strikethrough~</code>: Tildes are used for strikethrough. Shows
      as: <strike>strikethrough</strike>.

      - <code>||spoiler||</code>: Double vertical bars are used for spoilers.
      Shows as: <tg-spoiler>Spoiler</tg-spoiler>.

      - <code>```pre```</code>: To make the formatter ignore other formatting
      characters inside the text formatted with '```', will be like:
      <code>**bold** | *bold*</code>.

      - <code>__underline__</code>: Double underscores are used for underlines.
      Shows as: underline. NOTE: Some clients try to be smart and interpret it
      as italic. In that case, try to use your app's built-in formatting.

      - <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for
      hyperlinks. Shows as: <a href='https://example.com/'>hyperlink</a>.

      - <code>[My Button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>: This is the
      formatting used for creating buttons. This example will create a button
      named "My button" which opens <code>example.com</code> when clicked.


      If you would like to send buttons on the same row, use the
      <code>:same</code> formatting.

      <b>Example:</b>

      <code>[button 1](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

      <code>[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)</code>

      <code>[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>

      This will show button 1 and 2 on the same line, with 3 underneath.
    Fillings: >-
      <b>Fillings</b>


      You can also customise the contents of your message with contextual data.
      For example, you could mention a user by name in the welcome message, or
      mention them in a filter!

      You can use these to mention a user in notes too!


      <b>Supported fillings:</b>

      - <code>{first}</code>: The user's first name.

      - <code>{last}</code>: The user's last name.

      - <code>{fullname}</code>: The user's full name.

      - <code>{username}</code>: The user's username. If they don't have one,
      mentions the user instead.

      - <code>{mention}</code>: Mentions the user with their firstname.

      - <code>{id}</code>: The user's ID.

      - <code>{chatname}</code>: The chat's name.

      - <code>{rules}</code>: Adds Rules Button to Message.

      - <code>{protect}</code>: Protects the content from being shared.

      - <code>{preview}</code>: Enables previews in the messages.

      - <code>{nonotif}</code>: Disables the notification for that message.
    Random: >-
      <b>Random Content</b>


      Another thing that can be fun, is to randomise the contents of a message.
      Make things a little more personal by changing welcome messages, or
      changing notes!

      How to use random contents:

      - %%%: This separator can be used to add  random replies to the bot.

      For example:

      <code>hello

      %%%

      how are you</code>

      This will randomly choose between sending the first message, "hello", or
      the second message, "how are you".

      Use this to make Alita feel a bit more customised! (only works in
      filters/notes)

      Example welcome message:

      - Every time a new user joins, they'll be presented with one of the three
      messages shown here.

      -> /filter "hey"

      hello there <code>{first}</code>!

      %%%

      Ooooh, <code>{first}</code> how are you?

      %%%

      Sup? <code>{first}</code>

      Locks can be used to restrict a group's users.

      Locking URLs will auto-delete all messages with URLs, locking stickers
      will delete all stickers, etc.

      Locking bots will stop non-admins from adding bots to the chat.


      **Example:**

      `/lock media`: this locks all the media messages in the chat.
