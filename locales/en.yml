  You can also customise the contents of your message with contextual data. For example,

  <b>Supported fillings:</b>

formatting_help_msg:
  Alita supports a large number of formatting options to make your
  messages more expressive. Take a look by clicking the buttons below!
formatting_markdown: '<b>Markdown Formatting</b>


  You can format your message using <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, <u>underline</u>,
  and much more. Go ahead and experiment!

  <b>Supported markdown</b>:

  - <code>`code words`</code>: Backticks are used for monospace fonts. Shows as: <code>code
  words</code>.

  - <code>_italic words_</code>: Underscores are used for italic fonts. Shows as:
  <i>italic words</i>.

  - <code>*bold words*</code>: Asterisks are used for bold fonts. Shows as: <b>bold
  words</b>.

  - <code>~strikethrough~</code>: Tildes are used for strikethrough. Shows as: <strike>strikethrough</strike>.

  - <code>||spoiler||</code>: Double vertical bars are used for spoilers. Shows as:
  <tg-spoiler>Spoiler</tg-spoiler>.

  - <code>```pre```</code>: To make the formatter ignore other formatting characters
  inside the text formatted with ''```'', will be like: <code>**bold** | *bold*</code>.

  - <code>__underline__</code>: Double underscores are used for underlines. Shows
  as: underline. NOTE: Some clients try to be smart and interpret it as italic. In
  that case, try to use your app''s built-in formatting.

  - <code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used for hyperlinks.
  Shows as: <a href=''https://example.com/''>hyperlink</a>.

  - <code>[My Button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>: This is the formatting used
  for creating buttons. This example will create a button named "My button" which
  opens <code>example.com</code> when clicked.


  If you would like to send buttons on the same row, use the <code>:same</code> formatting.

  <b>Example:</b>

  <code>[button 1](buttonurl:example.com)</code>

  <code>[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)</code>

  <code>[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>

  This will show button 1 and 2 on the same line, with 3 underneath.'
formatting_random: '<b>Random Content</b>


  Another thing that can be fun, is to randomise the contents of a message. Make things
  a little more personal by changing welcome messages, or changing notes!

  How to use random contents:

  - %%%: This separator can be used to add  random replies to the bot.

  For example:

  <code>hello

  %%%

  how are you</code>

  This will randomly choose between sending the first message, "hello", or the second
  message, "how are you".

  Use this to make Alita feel a bit more customised! (only works in filters/notes)

  Example welcome message:

  - Every time a new user joins, they''ll be presented with one of the three messages
  shown here.

  -> /filter "hey"

  hello there <code>{first}</code>!

  %%%

  Ooooh, <code>{first}</code> how are you?

  %%%

  Sup? <code>{first}</code>'
