# Progress: french-translation

## Goal

Add French language support to Alita Robot by creating fr.yml locale file.

## Status

- Phase: tasks (in progress)
- Started: 2026-01-16

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Create fr.yml with metadata and admin module - 75b4a28

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- Synthesis: en.yml has 2191 lines, existing locales (es, hi) follow same structure
- Codebase pattern: i18n system uses flat YAML key-value pairs with printf-style formatters
- Critical finding: Double quotes required for strings with `\n` escape sequences (documented in CLAUDE.md)
- Assumption: Professional French translations will be provided (not machine translation)
- Locale activation: Must add "fr" to ENABLED_LOCALES env var for French to appear in language selector
- GetLangFormat() function reads `language_name` and `language_flag` keys to display in language picker
- Task 1.1: Created fr.yml with 34 admin_* keys (matches en.yml count) plus 3 metadata keys
- Verification: yq not available, used bun with js-yaml for YAML validation

## Next
Task 1.2: Add common strings and language module
