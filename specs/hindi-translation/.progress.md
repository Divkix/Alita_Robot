## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- i18n system auto-discovers locale files by filename pattern (*.yml)
- Language code extracted from filename: hi.yml -> "hi"
- 818 translation keys in en.yml as of 2026-01-16
- Required identity keys: language_name, language_flag, lang_sample
- Spanish (es.yml) exists as reference for translation patterns
- Format specifiers (%s, %d) must be preserved in exact positions
- HTML tags must remain balanced for Telegram formatting
- Double quotes required in YAML for escape sequences (\n, \t)
- Admin module has 34 keys total (not ~30 as estimated)
- Multi-line strings in YAML use | for literal blocks
- Common/utility keys across 5 prefixes: common_, utils_, helpers_, button_, format_ = 102 keys total
- Help message keys: 21 total (_help_msg suffix) covering all major modules
- Help messages contain Markdown formatting (*bold*, `code`) that must be preserved
- antispam_help_msg uses YAML literal block (|) for multi-line HTML content
- YAML duplicate keys cause silent overwrites - always check with uniq -d
- Extended docs (_docs keys) are multi-line blocks that inflate line count
- All en.yml keys (by key name) are now present in hi.yml - verified with diff
