## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Code is source of truth — docs adapt to code, never reverse
- [Init]: Fix locale tooling before any i18n work (check-translations path bug is a blocker)
- [Init]: Establish canonical command inventory before touching any documentation surface

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: HI locale gap (~18% missing) may require bilingual contributor or translation service — cannot be resolved programmatically. Start early in Phase 3 to avoid blocking delivery.
- [Phase 4]: Filter vs blacklist interaction behavior must be confirmed by live testing before documenting. Do not commit docs on this interaction without observed test results.
