# v1.0 Milestone Audit: Documentation & Command Consistency Audit

**Audit history:**
- Audit 1 (2026-02-28): `gaps_found` — 3 unsatisfied, 2 partial requirements (generate-docs overwrote Phase 2 edits)

### Orphaned Requirements

None. All 25 requirements appear in at least one phase VERIFICATION.md and at least one SUMMARY frontmatter.

## Audit History — Gap Resolution

### Audit 1 → Phase 6 (gap closure)

Phase 5's `make generate-docs` overwrote Phase 2's manual edits to `api-reference/commands.md` and `callbacks.md`.

| Gap | Resolution | Evidence |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| DOCS-02 unsatisfied (129 cmds) | Restored 142 commands + sentinel | 06-VERIFICATION: PASS |
| DOCS-05 unsatisfied (old codec) | Restored versioned codec + sentinel | 06-VERIFICATION: PASS |
| DOCS-07 unsatisfied (no Permission col) | Restored Permission column + sentinel | 06-VERIFICATION: PASS |
| DOCS-03 partial (aliases lost) | 8 "Alias of" entries restored | 06-VERIFICATION: PASS |
| DOCS-04 partial (disableable context) | 17 disableable checkmarks restored | 06-VERIFICATION: PASS |

### Audit 2 → Phase 7 (tech debt closure)

| Gap | Resolution | Evidence |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| generateModuleDocs() lacks sentinel | Guard added at generators.go:34 | 07-VERIFICATION SC-1: PASS |
| 21 module pages unprotected | All 21 contain sentinel comment | 07-VERIFICATION SC-2: PASS |
| Working tree dirty after generate-docs | Clean round-trip verified | 07-VERIFICATION SC-3: PASS |
| 13 SUMMARY files missing metadata | All 18 SUMMARY files have requirements_completed | 07-VERIFICATION SC-4: PASS |
| Developer Tooling Flow broken | All 3 E2E flows now pass | Integration checker: 3/3 |

### Missing Connections

None. All integration points verified.

## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: Documentation Consumer Flow — COMPLETE

User navigates docs site → correct counts (24 modules / 142 commands) → clicks module → accurate command table with alias blockquotes → api-reference for full list → all links valid → 52 pages built clean.

### Flow 2: Operator Knowledge Flow — COMPLETE

Admin reads handler-groups.md (11-row table, groups -10 to +10) → cross-link to request-flow.mdx → anonymous-admin.md with rendered Mermaid diagram → devs/index.md with 3-tier access table (9 commands mapped to guard conditions).

### Flow 3: Developer Tooling Flow — COMPLETE (fixed by Phase 7)

`make generate-docs` runs → sentinel skips commands.md and callbacks.md → sentinel skips all 21 module pages → `make check-translations` passes (0 errors) → docs build clean (52 pages, "All internal links valid") → working tree clean (no dirty module pages).

## Residual Tech Debt

| Item | Severity | Impact |
|------|----------|--------|
| `generateCommandsOverview()` has no sentinel guard — produces untracked `commands/index.md` | Low | Astro resolves .mdx over .md; no build impact. Pollutes `git status` only |
| Four `api-reference/*.md` files have uncommitted formatting-only diffs | Low | Pre-existing from generate-docs run. No content regressions |
| Phase 7 SUMMARY files show `requirements_completed: []` | None | Correct — tech debt phase carries no formal requirements |

**Total:** 3 items, all low/no severity. None affect correctness or build.

## Scores

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Requirements | 25/25 | All satisfied across 3 sources |
| Phases | 7/7 | All 7 phase verifications passed |
| Integration | 18/18 | All connections wired (previous 18/19 resolved by Phase 7) |
| Flows | 3/3 | All E2E flows complete (previous 2/3 resolved by Phase 7) |

## Verdict

**passed** — All 25 requirements satisfied and verified across 3 independent sources. 7/7 phases verified. 18/18 cross-phase integration connections wired. 3/3 E2E flows complete. Residual tech debt is low-severity and does not affect correctness.

The milestone definition of done is met: every user-facing surface accurately describes what the bot actually does.
